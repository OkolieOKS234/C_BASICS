```c
#include <stdio.h>
```

This line is known as a C directive to help the compiler with the ability to use 

```c
printf()
```

```c
int main(){
/*
Basic sequence in C programming
*/
printf("Column A\tColumn B\tColumn C");
//output => Column A        Column B        Column C
printf("\nMy Computer's Beep Sounds Like This\a: !\n");
// output => My Computer's Beep Sounds Like This: !
printf("\"Letz\bs fix that typo and then show the backslash");
printf("character \\\" she said\n");
// output=> "Lets fix that typo and then show the backslashcharacter \" she said

return 0;
}
```

This line is a basic code in C programming.  

```c
int main(){} // This contains the main function that C needs to run your program

```

Using  printf()

```c

printf("Column A\tColumn B\tColumn C")

 /*printf helps you print text, numbers to the screen

* ""=> tells the compiler you are printing strings

\t => acts like a tab for extra space
